## _Overview_
LR-Angus is a restaurant web application that provides users with an interactive dining experience.
The system includes:
- **Menu browsing** – explore available dishes with details.
- **Delivery ordering system** – add items to cart, place orders, and proceed to payment.
- **Payment integration** – simulate a full purchase flow.
- **Table reservation module** – reserve tables by date, time, and party size, with real-time availability validation.
- **Home page image gallery** – an innovative animated carousel that continuously scrolls restaurant photos and allows pausing on hover.
  
The project was developed using Angular (client), Node.js + Express (server), and MySQL (database).
It was created as part of the Web Applications Development course in collaboration with a teammate.
